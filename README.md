# Using AI to combat Human Trafficking

## Overview and Origin

* Marinus Analytics.

* Marinus Analytics was founded in 2014.

* Cara Jones and Emily Kennedy is the founders of Marinus Analytics.

* Cara and Emily launched the company’s flagship application, Traffic Jam, in 2015. IT was built on research work that Emily Kennedy started with her senior honor thesis at Carnegie Mellon University. Traffic Jam is a repository of online classified resources and collects data from websites known to be frequented and used by human traffickers. It relies on internal research and feedback from users globally that comes in the structure of a title, body of text, imagery, date and location to help identify other potential sources and digital operations.

* The United States National Science Foundation and Bank of New York Mellon has invested in their work. In addition, social investment grants from The Forbes Funds, The Idea Foundry, UpPrize and Toyota have provided Marinus Analytics with about $1.74million in funding.

## Business Activities

* Marinus Analytics focuses on protecting the vulnerable and ending systemic exploitation and disrupting human trafficking, child abuse and cyber fraud.

* Marinus Analytics intended customers are law enforcement agencies and public safety professionals across the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and internationally. They have partnered with more than 80 law enforcement agencies around the world.

* Marinus Analytics flagship application, Traffic Jam creates intelligence to guide law enforcement agonies and public safety professional towards fighting organized crime, stop human trafficking and find missing persons. 

* It uses Amazon’s AWS Rekognition – it is a cloud-based image and video analysis service that can detect objects, scenes, faces, and inappropriate content and is powered by deep learning technology. It also uses Amazon Neptune, a cloud-based graph database service that allows the rapid development of apps that can use metadata to create links through highly connective datasets. 

## Landscape

* Marinus Analytics fights organized crime, stop human trafficking and find missing persons.

* According to ICAT (Inter-agency Coordination Group Against Trafficking of Persons), Tech Against Trafficking, a coalition of technology companies working to combat human trafficking and supported by different stakeholders including international organizations such the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the International Organization for Migration, has mapped more than 260 technology tools that support anti-trafficking work. Some major categories of technology currently being used by law enforcement, NGOs, academia and private sector to combat trafficking in persons include:
- Data aggregation and analysis
- Blockchain for traceability and provenance
- Artificial intelligence; and
- Facial Recognition

* There are many Governments, Private Sector Companies, Civil Society organizations and intergovernmental organizations that works to combat human trafficking and child sexual exploitation. An example of this is the WeProtect Global Alliance is a group of over 102 Governments, 70 Private Sector Companies, 105 Civil Society Organizations and 10 Intergovernmental organizations that has been leading initiatives since 2014 in ending online child sexual exploitation.

## Results

* In 2019, Traffic Jam helped to identify and estimated 3800 victims of sex trafficking alone. It has over 8 years of operational experience with over 3500 law enforcement and non-profit users and has analyzed over 800 million records. In 2020, it saved an estimated 70,000 hours of investigation and it is 60x faster than a manual search.

* Some of the core metrics used in this field to measure success are:
- number of arrests or prosecutions, 
- number of officials trained, 
- instances of cross-border investigation cooperation, 
- number of special interview suites established,
- number of relevant treaties ratified etc.

* Based on the available information Marinus Analytics is making a significant impact on the detection and prevention of human trafficking and child sexual exploitation using AI. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)
I would recommend Marinus Analytics to expand their services to focus on enhancing public safety through digital transformation and predictive crime analysis. In doing so it could leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to support officers in decision-making and crime prevention strategies. This would be a natural extension of the services and solutions they already provide. 
In addition, it could offer a solution to solve crimes and assist in public safety by processing and analyzing large data sets by recognizing patterns, comparing evidence and suggesting preventative measures, whilst working closely with the legal profession to expedite evidence discovery and case assessment, using data science and machine learning. 
Marinus Analytics could also decide to focus on and use their AI technology in combating online illegal trade by detecting and preventing illicit trade activities. 

* From my perspective by expanding the use of their AI technology, services and solutions, Marinus Analytics could become the leader in assisting Governments and Law Enforcement Agencies worldwide in combatting all sorts of criminal activity. 
* The use of artificial intelligence, data science and machine learning are a natural extension of the solutions Marinus Analytics already use and it won’t be a huge leap for them to use these technologies in expanding their existing capabilities.
